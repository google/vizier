        "\n",
        "- `jax.debug.print` to print values, even inside of jit-compiled code.\n",
        "- jit-able runtime error checking with `jax.experimental.checkify`.\n",
        "- `jax_debug_nans` flag to automatically detect when NaNs are produced in jit-compiled code.\n",

        "- TFP objects (bijectors, distributions, PSD kernels) have a `validate_args` boolean arg to `__init__`. If `True`, it runs additional (possibly expensive) runtime checks, e.g. to verify that parameters like `length_scale` are nonnegative. In TFP, we enable `validate_args` in unit tests, and use it as a debugging tool.\n",
        "- Reproducibility: All functions and methods in TFP rely on random number generation, such as the `sample` method of distributions, take a `seed` arg, which in JAX is an instance of `jax.random.PRNGKey`. This arg is mandatory in TFP-on-JAX, and ensures reproducible random number generation. See the `jax.random` [documentation](https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/jax.random.html) for more details.\n",
        "- Tests of sample statistics: TFP's internal `test_util` module includes [`assertAllMeansClose`](https://github.com/tensorflow/probability/blob/main/tensorflow_probability/python/internal/test_util.py#L349), which asserts that the mean of a sample is as expected, and diagnoses the statistical significance of failures.\n"

        "You might have noticed that the base classes of the bijectors and PSD kernels are `AutoCompositeTensorBijector` and `AutoCompositeTensorPSDKernel`. In TensorFlow, objects that inherit from `CompositeTensor` have a recipe that allows them to be flattened into collections of Tensors and rebuilt, so that they can cross `tf.function` boundaries and interact with TF control flow similarly to Tensors (e.g., be passed in a `while_loop`'s carried state). JAX has a similar notion called [Pytree](https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/pytrees.html). Subclassing the `AutoCompositeTensor*` versions of TFP base classes means that the class will be registered as a Pytree node (making use of shared CompositeTensor/Pytree machinery in TFP). For the Flax model to return a GP in JIT-compiled code, it's necessary for the GP and its PSD kernel to be Pytrees."
