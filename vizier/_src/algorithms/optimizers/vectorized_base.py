  The optimizer is stateless and will create a new vectorized strategy at the

  1. Ask the strategy for suggestions.
  2. Evaluate the suggestions to get rewards.
  3. Tell the strategy about the rewards of its suggestion, so the strategy can
  update its internal state.

  The optimization process will terminate when the time limit or the total
  objective function evaluations limit has exceeded.

  Attributes:
    strategy_factory: A factory for generating new strategy.
    max_evaluations: The maximal number of calls to score_fn. Each call
      evaluates eval_batch_size parameters in one call.

    The number of suggestions is determined by the strategy, which is the

    The converter should be the same one used to convert trials to arrays in the
    format that the objective function expects to receive. It's used to convert
    backward the strategy's best array candidates to trial candidates.
    In addition, the converter is passed to the strategy so it could be aware
    of the type associated with each array index, and which indices are part of
    the same CATEGORICAL parameter one-hot encoding.

        features_count) and returns a 1D Array (batch_size,).
      count: The number of suggestions to generate.
      prior_trials: Completed trials to be used for knowledge transfer. When the
        optimizer is used to optimize a designer's acquisition function, the
