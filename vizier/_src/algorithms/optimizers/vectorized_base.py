  The optimizer is stateless and will create a new vectorized strategy at the

  The optimizer is responsible for running the iterative optimization process

  1. Ask the strategy for suggestions.
  2. Evaluate the suggestions to get rewards.
  3. Tell the strategy about the rewards of its suggestion, so the strategy can
  update its internal state.

  The optimization process will terminate when the time limit or the total
  objective function evaluations limit has exceeded.

  Attributes:
    strategy: A factory for generating new strategy.
    n_feature_dimensions_with_padding: Number of feature dimensions including
      padding.
    n_feature_dimensions: Number of feature dimensions (less than or equal to
      `n_feature_dimensions_with_padding`).

    The ask-evaluate-tell optimization procedure that runs until the allocated

    The number of suggestions is determined by the strategy, which is the

    The converter should be the same one used to convert trials to arrays in the
    format that the objective function expects to receive. It's used to convert
    backward the strategy's best array candidates to trial candidates.
    In addition, the converter is passed to the strategy so it could be aware
    of the type associated with each array index, and which indices are part of
    the same CATEGORICAL parameter one-hot encoding.

    The optimization stops when either of 'max_evaluations' or 'max_duration' is
    reached.

      score_fn: A callback that expects 2D Array with dimensions (batch_size,
        features_count) and returns a 1D Array (batch_size,).
      count: The number of suggestions to generate.
      prior_features: Completed trials to be used for knowledge transfer. When
        the optimizer is used to optimize a designer's acquisition function, the
