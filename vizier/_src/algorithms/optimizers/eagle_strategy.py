"""Eagle Strategy Optimizer.

Implements a variation of Eagle Strategy without the Levy random walk, aka
Firefly Algorithm (FA) for the purpose of optimizing a given objective function.

Reference: Yang XS. (2009) Firefly Algorithms for Multimodal Optimization.
In: Stochastic Algorithms: Foundations and Applications (SAGA) 2009.
DOI: https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-04944-6_14

Firefly Algorithm Summary
=========================
FA is a genetic algorithm that maintains a pool of fireflies. Each
firefly emits a light whose intensity is non-decreasing in (or simply equal
to) the objective value. Each iteration, a firefly chases after a brighter
firefly, but the brightness it perceives decreases in distance. This allows
multiple "clusters" to form, as opposed to all fireflies collapsing to a
single point. Not included in the original algorithm, we added "repulsion" which
in addition to the "attraction" forces, meaning fireflies move towards the
bright spots as well as away from the dark spots. We also support non-decimal
parameter types (categorical, discrete, integer), and treat them uniquely when
computing distance, adding pertrubation, and mutating fireflies.

For more details, see the linked paper.

OSS Vizier Implementation Summary
=================================
The firefly are stored in three Numpy arrays: features, rewards, perturbations.
Each iteration we mutate 'batch_size' fireflies to generate new features. The
new features are evaluated on the objective function to obtain their associated
rewards and update the pool where improvement was obtained, and decrease the
perturbation factor otherwise.

If the firefly's perturbation reaches the `perturbation_lower_bound` threshold
it's removed and replaced with new random features.

For performance consideration, the 'pool size' is a multiplier of the
'batch size', and so each iteration the pool is sliced to obtain the current
fireflies to be mutated.

Passing prior trials is supported for knowledge-transfering from previous runs
of the optimizer. Prior trials are used to populate the pool with fireflies
which are closer to the optimum.

Note that the strategy assumes that the search space is not conditional.

Example
=======
# Construct the optimizer with eagle strategy.
optimizer = VectorizedOptimizer(
    VectorizedEagleStrategyFactory(),
)
# Run the optimization.
optimizer.optimize(problem_statement, objective_function)

# Access the best features and reward.
best_reward, best_parameters = optimizer.best_results
